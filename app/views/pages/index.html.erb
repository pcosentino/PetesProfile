      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Peter Libreri and I am currently a student at Rush in the Perfusion Technology Master’s Program. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I first learned about the field of perfusion as an undergraduate at Dominican University where I completed a Bachelors of Science. From early on I was fascinated by the innovation of technology and its applications in the medical field.  I credit my interest to Mr. Greg Mork who opened my eyes to the career of Perfusion. His presentation caught my attention and it was at that point I began exploring options for Perfusion training. I then decided to pursue my studies at Rush University.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I find the field of perfusion to be quite rewarding. It allows me to work with a team towards a common goal, patient care.  Being involved in patient care and following the patient from the moment of surgery to post-operative recovery is motivating and inspires me to continue to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am motivated, hardworking, and dedicated to the field of perfusion as well as patient care. My ultimate career goal is to find a job where I am able to work as a Perfusionist; where I may continue to be inspired by the patients I have the privilege of caring for during surgery.
